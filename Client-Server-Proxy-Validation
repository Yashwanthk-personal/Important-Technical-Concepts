Learning these and understanding it with examples will really help you to pass complex questions.

Let's Discuss!

Q1) What is Client-Side validations?
Ans: Client-side validation is the one which is basically done at the browser level where the user’s input is validated at the browser itself with no involvement of the server.

The client-side validation is usually done by script language such as JavaScript etc.

Example - Form Validations.

Q2) What do you understand by Server-side validation?
Ans: Server-side validation occurs where the validation and processing of user requests require the response from the server. To understand it more clearly, the user’s input is being sent to the server and validation is done using server-side scripting languages.

After the validation process, feedback is sent back to the client in the form of a dynamically generated web page.

When compared to the Client-Side validation process, the Server-side validation process is more secure because here application is protected against malicious attacks and users can easily bypass client-side scripting language.

Q3) What is a Proxy server?
Ans: The proxy server is a server that acts as an intermediary or is the one that lies between the client and the main server.

The communication between the main server and client-server is done through a proxy server as the client request of any connection, file, resources from the main server is sent through a proxy server and again the response from the main server or local cached memory to client-server is done through the proxy server.

Q4) What if an organization's growth is so rapid that standard testing procedures are no longer feasible? What should you do in such a situation?

Ans: This is a very prevalent issue in the software industry, especially with the new technologies that are being used in product development. In this case, there is no simple answer; however, you could:

- Hire people who are good at what they do.

- Quality issues should be ‘fiercely prioritized' by management, with a constant focus on the client.

- Everyone in the company should understand what the term "quality" implies to the end-user.
